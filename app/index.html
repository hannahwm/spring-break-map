We welcome you! Alternative Breaks don’t require any prior trail work experience, just a good attitude and a willingness to get a little dirty! At Natural Bridge State Park, you’ll get a taste of this Natural Wonder and Natural Beauty! 215 feet of solid rock, carved by the fingers of nature, span the steep ravine over Cedar Creek at Virginia’s Natural Bridge State Park.

Enjoy hiking, plant life, being outdoors, and sharing in the rich cultural and natural history of the area on this ASB! </p>
